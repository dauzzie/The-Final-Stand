Town Updates! (Kim)

(3/18) I added sketches for Beacon and Latia 

Beacon I thought that a more structured, symmetrical layout would fit the city, with a fancy tall lighthouse capital building. The houses would have more pointed / tall rooftops

Latia, being a water city, would be nifty to have on water where most of the buildings are out at water, utilzing wooden piers, planks, etc. to connect buildings. A few buildings would be on land, but close to the shore.
